The _input.csv_ file contains training data for the model, which is damage to global mangrove ecosystems from all recorded storms worldwide between 2001 and 2021.

The _ensembleModeling.R_ script includes the code for developing the ensemble model, with performance evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).

The _stochasticEventGeneration.R_ script generates over 10,000 stochastic events based on the historical input dataset.
