This site contains the code and data for the study Shifting storm damage to global mangrove ecosystems under a changing climate.

The input.csv file contains training data for the model, which is damage to global mangrove ecosystems from all recorded storms worldwide between 2001 and 2021.

The ensembleModeling.R script includes the code for developing the ensemble model, with performance evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).

The stochasticEventGeneration.R script generates over 10,000 stochastic events based on the historical input dataset.
